# tetrapodomorph_dermal_project
Analysis of dermal skeletal evolution in tetrapodomorph fishes.

This project analyzes micro-CT data from a number of extinct fishes (Sauripterus, Eusthenopteron, Tiktaalik) and also living taxa (Neoceratodus). These data inform the evolutionary trajectory of anatomies that were antecedents of the limb.
